## Purpose

Queen of Mean is a personal project I created cause I'm a car enthusiast who likes to tune up and paint cars in racing games.
The main goal is to centralize my tunes and liveries in one single place so it's easier to find what you want/need and access it.
Another goal of this project is to show my skills and creativty by creating a full fledged website with various important elements like a (fake, non functioning) store, a basket system, an account system, and various other technologies to experiment with them.

It'll contain many pages, a true identity I worked on for years now, as Queen of Mean (and related projects) are on my mind for years now.

The main page will be composed of a carousel with various news about the (fake for now, I'll probably trademark it soon) Queen of Mean and everythong that is related to it.
Then, you'll find a weekly showcase smaller carousel with a 2 text cards overlapping and fading away as the other one takes its place, to show related information.
You'll find communautary events right under it with special in game events we've created.
Finally, you'll get a small vertical carousel with a quick presentation of the other important sections of the website such as the Store, Team Atheris (a car club/association I have yet to make official) and Atheris Racing Team, an amateur e-sport team I'll create.
**please note that:**
- Team Atheris and Atheris Racing Team might get their own dedicated website if things take off someday. If that happens, I'll obviously update this README with the links to those pages.
- The website appearance may change from what's written here between now and its final version.

To make it simple: **it'll be my very first ambitious project I'm going to work on and I'll take all the time and lessons I need to make it perfect; just like I want it to be.**

## Technologies

- **Bootstrap4** _for a quick and easy setup._

**Please note that:**
**I may need to use JS in the future to implement some functionalities**,_but for now, we're focusing on the V1.0 of the project so we'll see that later !_
